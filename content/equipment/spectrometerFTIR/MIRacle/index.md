MIRacle ATR -fast and easy IR sampling
  - a universal ATR sampling accessory for analysis of solids, liquids, pastes, gels and intractable materials
  - highest IR throughput 
  - fully configurable â€“ ZnSe, Diamond/ZnSe and Ge crystal plates 
  - highest purity, type IIa diamond crystal and is chemically inert to acidic or caustic materials
  - liquids retainer and volatiles cover to reduce the amount  of evaporation of a highly volatile liquid sample on the surface of  the crystal
  - flow-through attachment for continuous monitoring or handling samples that pose a hazard from ambient exposure
