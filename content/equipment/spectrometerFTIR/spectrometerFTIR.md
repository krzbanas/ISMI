Accessories:

- MIRacle ATR -fast and easy IR sampling
  - A universal ATR sampling accessory for analysis of solids, liquids, pastes, gels and intractable materials
  - highest IR throughput 
  - fully configurable – ZnSe, Diamond/ZnSe and Ge crystal plates 
  - highest purity, type IIa diamond crystal and is chemically inert to acidic or caustic materials
  - liquids retainer and volatiles cover to reduce the amount  of evaporation of a highly volatile liquid sample on the surface of  the crystal
  - flow-through attachment for continuous monitoring or handling samples that pose a hazard from ambient exposure
  
- VeeMAX II – the ultimate specular reflection accessory
  - Selectable angle of incidence – from 30 to 80 degrees in one degree increments
  - Measurement of thin films and  monolayers to relatively thick films
  - Optimize specular reflectance results with selectable angle of incidence
  - Integrated position for IR polarization (KRS-5 for mid-IR and polyethylene for far-IR) - essential for monolayer analysis and study of sample orientation 
  - Available sample masks: 2", 5/8" and 3/8"

- VeeMAX II with ATR – Variable Angle, Single Reflection ATR for Depth Profiling Studies
  - Continuously variable set angle of incidence – 30 to 80 degrees
  - 0.4 to 46 micron depth of penetration – dependent on crystal material, angle of incidence, sample’s refractive index and wavelength of IR beam – ideal for depth profiling studies
  - High throughput for excellent quality spectra in a short time period
  - Optional, high-pressure clamp for sampling of films, coatings or powdered samples
  - Liquid samples can be analyzed with optional liquid retainer
  - Flow-through attachment for continuous monitoring or handling samples that pose a hazard from ambient  exposure
