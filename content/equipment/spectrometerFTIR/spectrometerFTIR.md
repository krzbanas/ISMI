Accessories:

- [MIRacle ATR -fast and easy IR sampling]({{< ref "cv/index.md" >}})
  - a universal ATR sampling accessory for analysis of solids, liquids, pastes, gels and intractable materials
  - highest IR throughput 
  - fully configurable – ZnSe, Diamond/ZnSe and Ge crystal plates 
  - highest purity, type IIa diamond crystal and is chemically inert to acidic or caustic materials
  - liquids retainer and volatiles cover to reduce the amount  of evaporation of a highly volatile liquid sample on the surface of  the crystal
  - flow-through attachment for continuous monitoring or handling samples that pose a hazard from ambient exposure
  
- VeeMAX II – the ultimate specular reflection accessory
  - selectable angle of incidence – from 30 to 80 degrees in one degree increments
  - measurement of thin films and  monolayers to relatively thick films
  - optimize specular reflectance results with selectable angle of incidence
  - integrated position for IR polarization (KRS-5 for mid-IR and polyethylene for far-IR) - essential for monolayer analysis and study of sample orientation 
  - available sample masks: 2", 5/8" and 3/8"

- VeeMAX II with ATR – Variable Angle, Single Reflection ATR for Depth Profiling Studies
  - continuously variable set angle of incidence – 30 to 80 degrees
  - 0.4 to 46 micron depth of penetration – dependent on crystal material, angle of incidence, sample’s refractive index and wavelength of IR beam – ideal for depth profiling studies
  - high throughput for excellent quality spectra in a short time period
  - optional, high-pressure clamp for sampling of films, coatings or powdered samples
  - liquid samples can be analyzed with optional liquid retainer
  - flow-through attachment for continuous monitoring or handling samples that pose a hazard from ambient  exposure
  
- Beam condenser 4x
  - the compact design employs input transfer optics using flat folding mirrors to direct the IR beam to the ellipsoidal mirror and to the sample focus.
  - the output transfer optics converts the beam back to the original F-number needed to properly direct the beam to the spectrometer detector.
  - the typical 6 mm diameter sample compartment focal point is reduced to 1.5 mm using the 4x Beam Condenser
  - at ISMI also micro-rotation stage is available for angle-dependent experiments
