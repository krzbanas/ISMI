## O-PTIR (optical Photothermal IR) spectroscopy

- A pump-probe optical spectroscopy technique (“pump” - an IR laser , “probe” - a short-wavelength visible/NIR laser)
- Sub-micron spatial resolution: Raman-like spatial resolution, with IR spectral information
- FTIR transmission-like spectra in reflection mode by measuring the response of IR absorption (no distortions, artefacts or interference fringes) 
- Non-contact technique that minimizes sample preparation and preserve molecular orientation
- Spatial resolution is IR wavelength independent
