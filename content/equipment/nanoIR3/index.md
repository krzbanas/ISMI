# Anasys/Bruker Nano nanoIR3
The nanoIR3 is the latest generation nanoscale IR spectroscopy, chemical imaging, and property mapping system for both materials and life science applications. The system also provides IR-based chemical imaging to provide mapping of chemical variations of the feature of interest. Unique point spectroscopy capabilities provide both spectroscopy and chemical imaging with a single source.

Features:

- **Model free IR spectroscopy:** 
      reliable acquisition of nanoscale absorption data
- **Sub-10 nm Tapping AFM-IR:**
      chemical mapping at the highest spatial resolution, high-quality IR spectroscopy.
- **HYPERspectra imaging**
- **High-Performance monolayer sensitivity:** 
      the most sensitive technique for nanoscale spectroscopy of organic materials
      
Additional modalities: 
- [**Thermal Analysis:**]({{<ref"/accessories/Thermal-Analysis/index.md">}})
      TTM (Transition Temperature Microscopy) â€“image the transition temperature across the sample surface; 
- **Lorentz Drive Contact Reasonance Mode:**
      nanomechanical response on sample
