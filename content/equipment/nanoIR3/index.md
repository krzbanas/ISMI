The nanoIR3 is the latest generation nanoscale IR spectroscopy, chemical imaging, and property mapping system for both materials and life science applications. The system also provides IR-based chemical imaging to provide mapping of chemical variations of the feature of interest. Unique point spectroscopy capabilities provide both spectroscopy and chemical imaging with a single source.

Features:

- **Model free IR spectroscopy:** 
      reliable acquisition of nanoscale absorption data
- **Sub-10 nm Tapping AFM-IR:**
      chemical mapping at the highest spatial resolution, high-quality IR spectroscopy.
- HYPERspectra imaging
- High-Performance monolayer sensitivity 
      the most sensitive technique for nanoscale spectroscopy of organic materials
- Thermal Analysis
      TTM (Transition Temperature Microscopy) â€“image the transition temperature across the sample surface; 
- LorentzDrive Contact Reasonance Mode
      nanomechanical response on sample
