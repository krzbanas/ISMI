Details about the microscope

|  Variable | Value |
| --- | --- |
|  Device | FTIR Microscope Hyperion 3000 Bruker |
|  Spectral Range | 400-4000 cm<sup>-1</sup>|
|  Spectral Resolution | 2 cm<sup>-1</sup>|
|  Beam-splitter | KBr |
|  Detectors | FPA, MCT |

Accessories:
- Micro Diamond Cell (1.6 mm aperture)
  - small samples are easily held in place and flattened to ideal thicknesses for FTIR analysis
  - the diamond windows in this cell are Type IIA synthetic for excellent transmission from the UV through far-IR spectral regions
  - the hardness of diamond enables maximum pressure to be applied to all types of crystalline, fiber, or amorphous materials. 
  - typical samples include fibers, paint chips, rubbers, and plastic materials including laminates. 
  - mounted on a standard 2”x 3” plate.
 
- press


Objectives:
- Transmission/Reflection infrared Schwarzschild objective 15x 
- Transmission/Reflection infrared Schwarzschild objective 36x
- ATR objective with Ge crystal 20x
- GIR Objective 15x
- Viewing objective to observe the sample using visible light only 4x
