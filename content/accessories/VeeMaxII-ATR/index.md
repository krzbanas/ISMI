- VeeMAX II – the ultimate specular reflection 
  - selectable angle of incidence – from 30 to 80 degrees in one degree increments
  - measurement of thin films and  monolayers to relatively thick films
  - optimize specular reflectance results with selectable angle of incidence
  - integrated position for IR polarization (KRS-5 for mid-IR and polyethylene for far-IR) - essential for monolayer analysis and study of sample orientation 
  - available sample masks: 2", 5/8" and 3/8"

- VeeMAX II with ATR – Variable Angle, Single Reflection ATR for Depth Profiling Studies
  - continuously variable set angle of incidence – 30 to 80 degrees
  - 0.4 to 46 micron depth of penetration – dependent on crystal material, angle of incidence, sample’s refractive index and wavelength of IR beam – ideal for depth profiling studies
  - high throughput for excellent quality spectra in a short time period
  - optional, high-pressure clamp for sampling of films, coatings or powdered samples
  - liquid samples can be analyzed with optional liquid retainer
  - flow-through attachment for continuous monitoring or handling samples that pose a hazard from ambient  exposure
