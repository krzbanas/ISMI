Nanothermal analysis (nanoTA), pioneered by Bruker, integrated with nanoIR3 goes beyond the limits of traditional thermal analysis, achieving insights into:
- Tg and Tm transition measurements on thin films and nanoscale domains within polymer blends
- Spatial variation of polymer cross-linking; Cure rates/defects in coatings
- Composite materials
- Transition temperature microscopy to quantify and map thermal transitions (TTM)
- Scanning thermal microscopy (SThM) for device failure analysis and other applications
