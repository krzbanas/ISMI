- Beam condenser 4x
  - the compact design employs input transfer optics using flat folding mirrors to direct the IR beam to the ellipsoidal mirror and to the sample focus.
  - the output transfer optics converts the beam back to the original F-number needed to properly direct the beam to the spectrometer detector.
  - the typical 6 mm diameter sample compartment focal point is reduced to 1.5 mm using the 4x Beam Condenser
  - at ISMI also micro-rotation stage is available for angle-dependent experiments
