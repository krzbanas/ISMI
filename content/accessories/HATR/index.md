Multiple Reflection HATR – Maximum Sensitivity and Highly Versatile FTIR Sampling

- excellent energy throughput offering high signal-to-noise ratio and spectral quality
- up to 20 internal reflections for maximum sensitivity for low concentration components
- removable crystal plates with pinned positioning for high precision and quick cleanup
- available plates: ZnSe flat plate excellent for the analysis of solid materials including polymer and film sample; ZnSe through plate – for liquid, powder or paste
