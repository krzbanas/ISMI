ISMI (Infrared Spectro/Microscopy) beamline provides a state-of-the-art Fourier Transform IR spectrometer and microscope to supply diffraction-limited spatial resolution to an ever-widening range of infrared spectroscopy experiments. Synchrotron based source provides a versatile infrared source that covers a spectral range from 10000 to 10 cm<sup>-1</sup> and has considerable brightness advantages over conventional (thermal) IR sources enabling IR experiments with high resolution and studies of extremely small samples.
