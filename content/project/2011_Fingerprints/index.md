Fingerprint analysis, based on the unique pattern of human ridges, is the oldest method used in forensic science for personal identification of people involved in crime scene. The application of powders to latent fingerprints is a simple, common and long established method for their development. Fingerprints developed in situ at a crime scene routinely undergo lifting with specialist tapes and are then stored in evidence bags to allow secure transit and also to preserve the chain of evidence.
Our earlier experiments proved that FTIR spectromicroscopy is a rapid, powerful and nondestructive tool for identifying the small traces of contaminates like various types of chemicals, including drugs and high explosives, from the fingerprints, leaving them intact for further biometric analysis. In current work special disposable latent print powders (obtained from Singapore Police Force) were used to enhance the latent fingerprints, subsequently the FTIR analysis of contaminations found within fingerprints were performed.
All of the explosives materials and chemicals studied were successfully identified in powder-enhanced fingerprints, meaning that powder particles (atoms) seem not to mask/interfere with the lines belonging to analyzed substances. This method potentially could have a significant impact on real forensic science and could dramatically increase the amount of information that can be obtained from the study of fingerprints.
